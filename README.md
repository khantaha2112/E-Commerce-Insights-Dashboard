<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
This project analyzes Vishal E-commerce sales data to evaluate key financial and operational metrics, including revenue, profit, and customer behavior. The goal is to provide a comprehensive, interactive dashboard that allows stakeholders to monitor business health and make data-driven decisions.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="business-problem"></a>Business Problem</h2>
Vishal E-commerce needs a clear, centralized view of its performance to address core challenges:

Profitability Tracking: Lack of visibility into profit by category and sub-category prevents the optimization of pricing and promotional strategies.

Geographic Focus: Difficulty in identifying which states or regions are contributing the most (or least) to total revenue and profit.

Inventory & Demand Misalignment: Without clear sales trends by month, managing stock levels for seasonal items becomes inefficient, leading to inventory issues.

💾 <a class="anchor" id="dataset"></a>DatasetThe raw data is typically a single transactional CSV file (e.g., ecommerce_sales_data.csv) containing records for all sales.The key fields in the dataset include: Sales Amount, Profit, Quantity, Average Order Value ($\text{AOV}$), State, Category, Sub-Category, Customer Name, and Payment Mode.A summary table is created from this raw data for efficient visualization in Power BI.
